#Jeu de dame Java

a virtual draughts game playable in the terminal

## Presentation
This project has been entirely made with java and by Damien Drozd and Timothy Wu

## How to play
when launching the game, you have to choose if you want to play against the IA or by yourself. 
Then the first turn you have to chose a piece he want to move by entering in the terminal the case where the piece is,
after that done the console will ask where the player want to place the piece.
Once the piece have been moved, the second player or the AI will play and this pattern will repeat while no one have won.

There isnt many rule to know, only the fact that if you can eat someone the program will oblige you to eat
and the other rule is when a piece reach the end of the board, it ll become a Queen piece.
